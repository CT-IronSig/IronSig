# IronSig: Declaration of Digital Sovereignty
**White Paper v1.1 – Freedom First Edition (with Nostr Wallet Connect)**

---

## Declaration
We refuse to log in on our knees.  
We will not hand our identity to corporations, nor submit our freedom to states.  
We demand a world where access is not permissioned by gatekeepers, but proven by math.  

**Identity is sovereignty. IronSig is its shield.**

## 1. The Problem: Identity as a Weapon
Every year, billions of passwords are stolen. Every login box is a shackle.  

- Centralized logins (Google, Apple, Microsoft) are surveillance machines.  
- Authoritarian states wield identity systems as tools of censorship.  
- Even “new” approaches like passkeys keep you locked inside platforms.  

**Identity has been captured. What was once convenience is now control.**  

---

## 2. The IronSig Solution: Freedom-First Authentication
IronSig rips the password out at its roots. It replaces weak credentials with **Bitcoin-native cryptographic signatures** and **Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)** — tools that no corporation or state can corrupt.  

- **Passwordless by Default** – Nothing to phish, nothing to steal.  
- **User-Controlled Keys** – Your identity lives in your wallet, not their database.  
- **Censorship Resistant** – Works through firewalls, borders, shutdowns.  
- **Open & Verifiable** – Built on BIP-322, LNURL-auth, Nostr signing, and NWC.  

*With IronSig, your key is your passport.*

## 3. Why Bitcoin? Why Nostr?
Bitcoin is incorruptible money.  
Nostr is unstoppable communication.  

By building on these rails, IronSig inherits:  
- **Resilience** – a trillion-dollar network defending every signature.  
- **Verifiability** – trustless math, not trusted middlemen.  
- **Censorship Resistance** – no government can turn Bitcoin off, no regime can silence Nostr.  

Together, Bitcoin + Nostr form the backbone of **sovereign authentication.**

## 4. Nostr Wallet Connect: Remote, Permissioned Signing
IronSig integrates **NWC** so that users can sign logins remotely from their wallet — without ever exposing their private keys.  

- Remote signing via Nostr relays.  
- Granular permissions (sign only this, pay only that).  
- Revocable at any time.  
- Per-app keys to isolate risk.  
- Relay-agnostic, surviving censorship.  

*Imagine logging into a website in one country while your wallet rests safe in another.*  
*Imagine revoking a compromised connection instantly, without begging a support desk.*  
*Imagine authentication that obeys you — and only you.*  

This is the power of NWC inside IronSig.

## 5. Market & Mission
IronSig is not a product. It is a movement.  

- First adopters: developers, privacy advocates, human rights defenders.  
- Next wave: enterprises mandated to adopt Zero-Trust.  
- Long-term: a universal, sovereign authentication shield for the free internet.  

*We are not here to chase hype. We are here to defend freedom.*  

---

## 6. Security Model
- Keys never leave the wallet.  
- Challenge-response protects against replay.  
- Domain binding ensures only real sites can request signatures.  
- Revocation + rotation keep connectors safe.  
- Hardware wallets + NWC extend protection to the edge.  

This is Zero-Trust, but without the trust in corporations.  

---

## 7. Roadmap
- **2025** – MVP: SDKs, NWC login flows, first integrations.  
- **2026** – Enterprise toolkit, compliance templates, on-prem relay options.  
- **2027+** – Defense, government, and global civil society adoption.  

IronSig is not a sprint. It is a shield forged to last.  

---

## 8. The IronSig Ethos
- Sovereignty First.  
- No Data Honeypots.  
- Open Source & Transparent.  
- Freedom as a Feature.  

---

## Conclusion
The old internet was built on trust in corporations and states. That trust was betrayed.  

**IronSig is the authentication layer for the sovereign internet — borderless, user-owned, censorship-proof.**  
With Bitcoin, with Nostr, with NWC, the power to log in is no longer a gift they grant. It is a right you hold.  

The fight for freedom is moving online.  
**With IronSig, you hold the keys.**
